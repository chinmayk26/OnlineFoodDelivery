# Introduction

It is a website for  connecting people with great restaurants and dining experiences around them for the past seven years. 
Today, weâ€™re taking that a step further with the launch of Delicious Delights, a platform thatenables restaurants to deliver 
their authentic flavors at one's own doorstep from the comfort of their houses. For customers, this allows for one-on-one interactions with their favourite restaurants, access to exclusive events and offers, and loyalty programs, without
having to navigate to them on the Delights own Website.We are designed to help you effortlessly find great places to eat, 
tasty new recipes to cook at home,and the latest restaurant openings around town.

# Objectives

The general objective of the platform is to develop a reliable, convenient and accurate Ordering System.
The platform has the following specific objectives:
1. Building a responsive online application for various restaurants which helps 
   customers to have a profound experience.
2. Social media API will be integrated to the application so customers can login in with their Social media 
   account and see the reviews and likes of their friends and relatives who used the service earlier.
3. Food enthusiasts can login in and post food blogs and food photographs which would enable them to interact 
   with a greater audience. Visitors can also follow their favourite bloggers.
4. Visitors can also check out tasty recipes by renowned chefs and bookmark the ones they like.
5. It will also provide advanced dine-in booking options for selected restaurants.

## Setup of the Project 

# `install XAMPP`

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.

Once installed on your local machine start the SQL and Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.

# `Open URL on your Web Browser`

Once the Services are started, Open the browser and type the url set for XAMPP in my case it was "http://localhost:3000/htdocs/homepage.php"

Here,
3000 is the port number which is specified for XAMPP( which was set during the XAMPP control panel installation).
htdocs is the folder to which we are redirecting, Since the program files are in this folder.
homepage.php is the root file of the website.
